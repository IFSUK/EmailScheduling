How to Send Scheduled Email (other than Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo)

I'm looking for a solution whereby I can delay the sending of my emails.  Essentially an email scheduler.

i do not use Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook etc. I use the email service by Tutanota whose website is:
https://tutanota.com/


Tutanota does not have this feature in its email system which is why I need a custom solution.

if you can assist let me know.
